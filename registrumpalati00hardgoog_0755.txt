APPENDIX.

nster the text, praiaco, and index of this volume were
printed, the materiale occurring at pp. est-531, were
discovered by my friend ΜΓ. Charlea Τ. Martia, in a
MS. in the British Museum;¹ as they supply some of
the missing portione of Kellawe’s Registcr, I have
deomed it expedient to insert them here by way of
Appendirr.

The manuscript from which they are taken, at one
time belonged to John Wessyngton, prior of Durham, ,
as appears by the memorandum supposed to be in his
own handwriting, “ Liber diri J otis Wesshyngton prioris
“ Duneliir.''

Wessington was at first a monk of Durham, and
became prior of that celebrated house in the year 1416.
After holding the office sor nearly 30 years, with much
credit to himself, and to the full satisfaction of hie
brethren‚ he died in 1446.

He was one of the few priora of Durham who have
been distinguished for literary pursuita5 he appears to
have employed all his time not devoted to his relig10us
and monastic duties to historical investigatione, and to
have made several compilatione for the defense of his
monastery-a record of which is preserved ina Roll at
Durham.² As this codex is not mentioned in the list it
