edition of the Paston Letters published in 1872-1875.
ΜΓ. Gairdner, in his recent edition of those Historicel
Papers, points out and correcte several instances of mis-
readr'ngs of abbreviated words. For instance, says Mr.
Gairdner, at the end of letter printed in Fenn, Vol. 111,

adopted the name of Bury, on account of ile proximity
to the ploce of his birth.
