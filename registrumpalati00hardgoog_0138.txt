I have endeavoured to arrange the abbreviatione dic-
tionary-wisc, but I have not been able fully to carry
out that plan, many words being contracted iu five or six

different ways, and it was found convenient occasionally
to placa them under one of such words. They are, how-
ever, in sufficient alphabetical order to be easily traaed
or recognised.

The usual way of shortening words was to omit one
01· more letters in each word3 to substitute in their stead
certain symbols and superior letters.

The abbreviatione commonly used by scribes were a
small right line (—) placed horizontally over a vowel in
the middle of a word; this denotes the omission of one
letter as in vadat (vendant) ; when it occurs at the end os
’ a werdae in Londofi (Londouiae), it denotas the omission
of more than one letter; when it is found at the aad os
a word, and not over a letter, it shows the writing to be
of very great antiquity. A curve approaching the form
of the Greek circumflex (a) also placed horizontally
over a letter or lettera, either in the middle or at the
end os a word, significa the omission of more than one
letter, but the number of letters wanted isto be ascer-
tained by the reader‚ aa in aia (anima), ah· (aliter), alia
(animalia), Wintoii (wintonia), nob (nobis), mand
(mandatum).

During the thirteenth century abbreviatione were so
numerous as to amount to apositive inconvenience‚ yet no
step was taken in England to lirnit their uso. In Franco,
however, Philippa le Bel banished them in the yca1·1304
from the minutos of notaries, more especially those which
subjected their notes to be salsified or misunderstood.

Several other symbols have positive and defined sig-
nificatione when they occur above the linc, as ‘l3 this
usually stands for er or re, and occasionally to, and fol-
lows the letter which precedes the omission as the sense
requires, thus ‘lra for terra, {idictus for predictas, serie,
servire. For tho word et, the character ‘t is used, aud
