Ihave adducedaverylnrgenumber of instances, though
by no means all, of words wiongly extended in the first
fourteen volumes of the Foedera, because nearly ull the

pisces therein introduced were taken from the Public
&corde⁸ I have not, however, given the passages where

these misreadings occur, for fear of occupying too much
space, perhaps some may think that too much has been
already devoted to this subject; but ii the critic will
compare the first edition published in symers lifetime
with the second edition issued by Tonson, with Holmes’s
porrectione, he will at once see that I might have in·
oreased the number oi errata by several hundreds.

One of the disadvantages arising from these errorsis
that many of these misread words have been cited and
arrepted in Mediaeval Iatin and French Dictionaries, as
authorities for the use of such words. I have not, how-
ever, considered it necessary to give one fourth of the
misreadings I found I merely wish to establish my
point thet Records ought not, as a mle, to be printed
in full, or rather thet abbreviated words for legal pur·
poses ought not to be extended. I am, however, fully
aware that strong objections against that course are
entertained by some persons whose opinions are oi great
weight ; but, on the whole, Ibelieve it is safer to adhere
to theold English practice of printing Record works in
fac-simile. One of the grounds for this opinion is that,
in caso oi destruction by fire or damp or other mischanee
oi a Public Record‚ of which no copy exists, there would
remain evidence of what were the exact words of the
destroyed document.

Let it not, however, be supposed that Ryrner is the only
editor who has fallen into the error of extending words
wrongly3 Iwould, however, direct attention to Fenn's
