throws considerable and important light on the his-

tory of this “imperium in impen'oj’ and gives in detail
the various causes of the bitter quarrels between that
prelato and Richard de Hoton, the turbulent prior of

Durham, some account of which was given in the

⁴ Preface to the First Volume.

¹The origin of the quarrel seems to have arisen from
the bishop compelling the tenantry of the prior and
conventos Durham to follow him to the war in Scot-
land, with horses and arms. Upon their returning
home on the second occasion without receiving permis-
sion from him, he had some ol thern imprisoned at
Durham. This they naturally considered an indignity,
and made a party against him on the ground that they
were Holyworkfolk and held· their londs for the del’ence ι
of the ¹body of St. (luthbert, and not at the bishop’s
pleasure, and that they ought not to do service beyond
the limite of the bishopric, vin, the Tyne and the Tem,
for either King or bishop.

Disgusted with the part played hythe prior, the
hishop determined to depose him. He then directed the

monks to elect another prior in his stead. Upon their .

declining to comply with this mandate he translated
H. de Luc'ehy'(pn'or of Holy Island) to tho priory of
Durham and gave directions to his forestem ol Wardale
and his men of Tyndale to lay siege to the abhey, to

keep the prior and monks in strict confinement, and Ι

not permit victuals of any description to be brought
into the priory. In carrying out the bishop’s orders
they destroyed the aqueduot of the priory, broke down

f the gates of the cloistem, and besieged the prior and

monks in their church for the space of three days, de-
priving them of food. They even dragged the prior
from his stall and imprisoned him. This is the account
given by Rohert de Graystanes,the contemporary Durham
historias, ondit is fully confirmed by the Roll of Pleas

in question.
