Agein by another misteke, Dugdale (iii, ool. 1, p. 102)
makes aiabus to eignify mabnnltbas instead of ababa}
thus making the Whitington olmspeople pray daily for the
ambulo of the donorand his wife, instead of their ‘aeota

A very ridiculous illustretion ofa wrong extension
ooeurs in the Aneient Martyrolge of St. Jerome, where
mention ismade of eleven martyre, oompenions of St.
Pamphilius. After the words «iuliani oum AEgyptiis V„
there oeeurs the word mil, the abbreviation sor mattea
The copyist atter the word Juliani has written in¹ full
“ oum aliis quinque millibus‚'’ thus turning five martyre

’ into five thousand.2

Α similar misreading oeoure respecting S. Ursula and
her eompanions, where the abbreviation XI. M. V„ signi-
iying eleven virgin martyre, has been eonverted into
11‚000 virgins.

Other instantes ean be adduoed where the abbrevia-
tion of M. or Mil ismede to signify soldiers or thousands.
The 10,000 Christian soldiers who are said to have been
eruoified in one day on Mount Areae cannot he read
without a smile of ineredulity.

Another very eurious and grave error ooours in the
new edition of the Foedera, vol. i.‚ p. 144 (not one of

Rymer’s errore, to be notieed presently‚ but one of Dr.
Adam Olarlre, the ohosen editor of the new editiones

that great national work). In the entry as it stands
Walter de Montgomery is styled Eurl of Ferrers, whereas
it should be Walter Montgomery, the knight of the
Earl of Ferrers, and Dr. Olarke oites the· patent of the
eighteenth year of the reign of King John ae the autho·

Olose Roll of that year the entra¹ is quoted right, “Man-
