On the 26th of Ianuary 1857, the Mastor of the Rolls
submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication ,
of materials for the History oi this (lountry from the
Invasion of the Romans to the reign of Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected for publication under competent “
editors without reference to periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer·
enee being given, in the first instance, to such materials
as were most scarce and valuahle.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical docu-
ment to be edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps ; and
for this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accincto collation of the hest Mas

'Io render the work more generally nselul, the Master
of the Bolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed hy him, oi their age and
their peculiarities ; that he should add to the work a
brief account of the life and times of the author, and
any remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but
no other note or comment was to be allowed, except
what might be necessary to establish the correctness of

the text.
