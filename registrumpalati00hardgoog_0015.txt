this work that several leaves of Kellawe's Register had
been abstracted from the manuscript, as well as the
whole of the proceedings of the first five years of Biehop
Bury’s pontificale.

In the expectation of being able to* supply those
deficiencies, Ι deemed it necessary to examine the Public
Muniments during the periods when those two bishops
occupied the palatinate of Durham, and to gether there·
from such entries es would furnish ini'ormation likely
to ffll up the gups in the portions of those two Registers
now missing. The result of this examination appears
in the ensuing pages.

The render, however, should be apprised that some
pieoes have been introduced, which, in all probability,

would not have found a ploce in the Register¹ even had '

it come down to us in a perfect state, but as they relate
to the Palatinate, and contribute many links to the
chain of its ecclesiastieal and local history, they have
not been rejected, especially as the information con·
tairred in them could not be obtained from other sources.
Among these additions, though belonging to an earlier
period, is the Roll of Pleas held at Durham in the
thirty-third year of the reign of Edward 1, when the
'bishopric had been seized into the hands of the Orown
on account of the inordinate and intemperate ambition
of Bishop Antony Bek. This noll, the only record now
extant of the same nature relating to the Palatinate,
