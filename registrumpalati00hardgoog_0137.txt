APPuNDIX ΤΟ Pharoou.

The following Tables of Abbreviotious¹ contain many
more examples than will be found in the first volume of
the “Rotuli Litterarum Clausorum,” publiehod in the
year 1833. Imperfect ae thoseTables were they have
been several times reprinted by other persons, without
any enlargement3 thus proving their general utility by
supplying a requirement that wae experienced by all
persons desirous of reading Records.

The student, however, must not expect to find in
these tables examples of ull the abbreviatione scattered
about in the numerous MSS. which 'are now extant,
extending from the sixth to the fourteenth century,
because it is next to impossible to denote in type all the
minutiae of the abbrevatione in some MSS. I have only
introduced those with which I am familiar ; but there arc
many recorda where almost every word iscontracted, and
il all had been notioed the tables would have been quad·
rupled in extent, inasmuch ae the, same word is repeated
in various waye Several ancient exemplos, however,
that are not of common occurrence have been inserted,
because they are found in early chartere, chronicles, and
other early MSS. relating to England before the end of
the tenth century.

Ihave aleo introduced from the work of M. (lhaasant
some of the principal abbreviatione occurring in Roman
inscriptions and epitapha and also some few of the
legende on ancient coine connected with Euglaud.
