“ l'equivoque qu'on y voit regner assez hequemment”

So necessary was a knowledge of the velue of ancient
abbreviatione to studente and scholare that several werke
have been written to explain them. The authors of the
Nouveau Trcitb, iii 547, make mention of a work en·
titled“h10dus legendi abreviaturas in utroque jure,”
printed in 8vo.· at Paris in 1498 by John Petit. They
say that without a knowledge of these abbreviatione it
is impossible te decipher certain important MSS, which
are without points or stops. Baringius published at
Hanover in 1737 “Olavis diplomatica,” the characters
of which are in Gothic, commencing with the lach cen-
tury. The Abbe Godfroi de Beescl has given a table of
such abbreviatione cs occur in MSS. of the llth century.
Anderson published inhia great work entitled “ Selectus
“ Diplomatum et Numismatum Scotiae Thesaurus ''
Tables of Abbreviations found in Scottish reeords and
diplomas from the llth century downwards; and Wal-
ther published his magnificent “ Lexicon Diplomcti-
“ cum abbreviationem? in which he denotes the
various ages in which the several abbreviatione are
common. The authors of the “Nouveau Traite de
“ Diplomatique '' have written a learned and exhaustive
account (vol. iii. pp. 537 ct seq.) of abbreviatione oom‘
monly found in ancient MSS, and they lament¹ that
France has not contributed her knowledge on this in·
teresting and usehd science. This reproach‚ however,
hasbeen lately removed by a valuable work by M. L.
Alph. Ohessant, entitled “Dictionnaire des Abreviations
“ Iatines et Frangaises usiteee dans les Inscriptions
¹‘ lapidaires et metalliquee‚ les Manuscrits et les Chartes‚”
athird edition of which was issued in 1866. I need
scarcely say that, in my tables of abbreviatione, I have
freely used all the werke above mentioned, together
with the table I published in the preface to the “ Rutuli
“ Litterarum clausarum, 1836.”
