because tho writ was precipimus titt instead of prect-
pimus vohis to the eheriffs of London.

Muoh discussion has taken place as to tho correct ex-
tension of the word Oom in Braoton (p. 77, ed. 1640)
in the sentence, “in rotulo de primis placitis post guer-
“ ram Gom. Esexss’ it has been extended into “ post
‘⁴ guerram eommunem,” on the supposition that it meant
‘¹ guerra eommunis‚'’ or yuerra gereretis, aa it ooeurs in
p. 240 of the same edition; whereas it means post guer-
ram comitam Essex, referring to pleae held before the
King’s justiees at the assiae in the oounty of Essem as
in p. 37612, where it occurs, “anno regni regis Henrioi
“ secundi post guerram in Comitatu Essex.''

again at p. 386 of the some volume, deiende is ex-
panded into domnos instead of discurrendo ; “ semel
“in oruoe '' into ‘¹ seilicet in eealesia;” qi into quare
instead of quid3 et has been extended cognatus instead
of eonventus; q³ expanded into qui instead of quia3
Di into Domini instead of Dei.

ludiorous, and show the danger of attempting to extend
eontraoted words.

The letters fri signify either fratri or fraewett, end
Dugdale in his Monostiooo ('''., p. 89), has extended
those letters into the first word instead of the latter.
The word oooura in an Inquisition, relative to the
cuatonis of the Hospital of Ripon‚ taken before the
Kings eseheator on Sunday in the Oet-sves of the feast
of the Virgin Mary, in the tenth year of the reign of
Edward the Second, where it is said “ that on the day of
“ the Blessed Many Magdalen, yearly for ever, to every
“ poor person that oometh, there ought to be distributed
‘⁴ orte wteotea toas, worth a halfpenny, and one hening,”
but the printed reading has “ meree paea fratri '’ instead
of mamati? which of course makes nonsense of the
Reoord
